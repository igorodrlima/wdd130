            <p>"I'm Igor Lima, I'm from Brazil, Minas Gerais. Currently living in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm 25 years old. I served a full time mission through 2015-2017. After 6 months that I was back home, I got married to my beloved wife Amanda and this month will be our 5th anniversary. After 6 months married we moved to Utah, and we studied there for 3 years in a language school to get our fluency in English. Last year we came back to Brazil and since then we have been studying through the BYU program. We have a 2 year old son, his name is Ephraim. I love my family. I'm so excited to be on this class and to meet you guys. I'm strongly compromised on my studies to do my best and to get my degree. With that I will be more capable to provide the best opportunities to my family."</p>
